What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A .git file appears in the folder. This is to keep track of commits and so-on

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is where the user puts files that he/she wants to commit to the repository.
	Files from the working directory are all local files. This is valuable because the user has
	the flexibility to choose which files to commit.
