What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A .git file appears in the folder. This is to keep track of commits and so-on

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is where the user puts files that he/she wants to commit to the repository.
	Files from the working directory are all local files. This is valuable because the user has
	the flexibility to choose which files to commit		

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?	
	
	We can commit one logical change at a time by only adding the single file with the logical
	change to the Staging Area by using the "git add" command on said single file

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	
	Testing out new features, rewriting a portion of the code, removing parts of the code. Branches make it easy to switch between these tasks without breaking the MASTER code
