When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to back up my data to the cloud, or collaborate with other people on the same project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Could be working on something that gets automatically pulled, thereby potentially interfering with the code currently being worked on
  and breaking something.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forking is to clone a repository into your own on GitHub, thereby being able to push to it, since not everyone would give
  collaborator status to any tom dick or harry

  clone is to copy a repository from remote to local

  branches are branches of commits within a particular repository. a clone only clones a specific branch, most commonly the master
  branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    We can compare the differences between the local and remote even without an internet connection.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  Probably SVN. Cant remember how that works. Git now would be infinitely easier to use and to
  collaborate with other people.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
  When we want to change something in existing code, or add some new features, or even remove some features. This way, we can
  continue to have a stable version of the software code, and have branches for any experiments on the software.
